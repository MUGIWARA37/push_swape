# Push_Swap

## Description
The **push_swap** project is a programming challenge from the 42 curriculum designed to test algorithmic thinking and mastery of stack operations. The goal of the project is to sort a stack of integers in ascending order using only a limited set of operations on two stacks (`a` and `b`) while minimizing the total number of operations.

The project requires implementing efficient algorithms for sorting, such as indexing values, using radix sort for large datasets, and handling edge cases like duplicates and integer overflows. The project also emphasizes writing clean, maintainable code that adheres to the Norminette coding standards.

## Instructions
1. **Compilation**:  
   Use the provided `Makefile` or compile manually using `gcc`. Example:
   ```bash
   gcc -Wall -Wextra -Werror -o push_swap *.c

## Resources
1. **PUSH_SWAP_GUILD**  
   Accessible via <https://42-cursus.gitbook.io/guide/2-rank-02/push_swap>. Provides a detailed explanation of the project in general, the sorting algorithms, and their complexity.

2. **YouTube Tutorials**  
   - Understanding the project and important flows: <https://youtu.be/OaG81sDEpVk>  
   - Learning the radix sort algorithm: <https://youtu.be/begDjnbCc1A>  

3. **Peer-to-Peer Learning**  
   Collaborating with colleagues and seniors helped understand the bit manipulation used in the radix algorithm and addressing edge cases that are difficult to catch alone.

4. **AI Usage**  
   AI was used to search for concise definitions, debug code, and suggest more efficient implementations for solving issues with lower complexity.
